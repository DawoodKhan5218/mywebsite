			<p>Hey guys! I'M 19 years old Dawood from a middle class family. Dreams are never ends because it's increasing day by day. Sometimes i dream of saving the digital world.

			<h2> "YOU CAN"

                    If you think you're beaten, you are... If you think you dare not, you don't... If you like to win... but think you can't... It's almost a cinch, YOU WON'T !!

                    If you think you'll lose, you're lost... For out in the world you'll find... Success begins with a fellow's will... It's all in a state of mind.

                    If you think you're outclassed, you are... You've got to think high to rise.... You've got to be sure of yourself before... You can ever win the prize.

                    Life's battles don't always go... To the stronger or faster man... But sooner or later the one who wins... IS THE ONE WHO THINKS HE CAN !!!</h2>
